# SilentPatch for AquaNox

SilentPatch for [AquaNox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/39630/AquaNox/),
fixing widely reported mouse control issues.
A bug present only in the first game (AquaNox 2 fixed it) would cause the game to drop mouse input
frequently when mice or keyboard with high polling rate have been used. It's now been fixed
the same way AquaNox 2 did.
